      <div class="faq-body">
        Like you, we realize that Philly has a litter problem. As citizens, we have what it takes to make a real difference.
        In return for a 6 month commitment to going out once a week to pick up litter, we will give you a trash grabber. No
        more touching litter or killing your back! You will be amazed at how much we can get done together! Send any questions to us at <a href="mailto:notinphilly@gmail.com" target="_blank">notinphilly@gmail.com</a>

      <div class="faq-heading">So, I signed up and I just get a grabber? Isn’t that kind of lame?</div>
      <div class="faq-body">
        We agree. Once enough people sign up, we will be able to solicit gifts and hold raffles from area businesses.

        <div class="faq-body">
          We want to give good press to companies, non-profits, and houses of worship that have their members take part.
